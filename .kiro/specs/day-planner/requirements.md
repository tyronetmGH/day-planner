# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Day Planner is a simple daily task scheduling application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to manage their daily tasks with time-based scheduling, providing a clean and minimal interface for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The application persists data locally using localStorage, ensuring tasks remain available across browser sessions without requiring a backend service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add tasks with specific times and titles, so that I can organize my daily schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click an "Add Task" button THEN the system SHALL display a form to input task details
2. WHEN I enter a time, title, and optional priority for a task THEN the system SHALL validate the input format
3. WHEN I submit a valid task THEN the system SHALL add it to the task list and sort by time
4. WHEN multiple tasks have the same time THEN the system SHALL preserve insertion order or use priority as a tiebreaker
5. IF I enter an invalid time format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing tasks, so that I can update my schedule when plans change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on an existing task THEN the system SHALL display an edit form with current task details
2. WHEN I modify the time, title, or priority of a task THEN the system SHALL validate the new input
3. WHEN I save changes to a task THEN the system SHALL update the task and re-sort the list by time
4. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL revert to the original task details
5. IF I enter invalid data while editing THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need, so that I can keep my schedule clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a delete button on a task THEN the system SHALL confirm the action before permanent removal
2. WHEN I delete a task THEN the system SHALL update the display immediately
3. WHEN I delete the last task THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to persist when I refresh the page, so that I don't lose my schedule data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add, edit, or delete a task THEN the system SHALL save the updated task list to localStorage
2. WHEN I refresh the page or reopen the application THEN the system SHALL load tasks from localStorage
3. WHEN localStorage is empty on first visit THEN the system SHALL display an empty task list
4. IF localStorage data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL clear the data and display a non-intrusive message indicating a reset

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and minimal interface, so that I can focus on my tasks without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, uncluttered interface
2. WHEN I interact with tasks THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
3. WHEN I view the task list THEN the system SHALL display tasks in a readable, time-sorted format
4. WHEN I use the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
5. WHEN I use the application on small screens THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively with stacked form inputs and vertical task list
6. WHEN I navigate the application THEN the system SHALL follow accessibility best practices including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear all tasks at once, so that I can quickly start fresh with my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "Clear All Tasks" button THEN the system SHALL confirm the action before removing all tasks
2. WHEN I confirm clearing all tasks THEN the system SHALL remove all tasks and display an empty state message
3. WHEN the task list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a default message such as "No tasks yet â€” add one to get started"

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for utility functions, so that I can ensure code reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate time parsing (valid and invalid inputs), sorting (including duplicate times), and localStorage persistence (save/load/empty/corrupted)
3. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain test coverage for critical functionality
4. IF a utility function fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and logging
